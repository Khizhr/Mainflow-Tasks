                   - Purpose: The backbone of web design, HTML structures the content on the web by defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other multimedia.<br>
                   - Example: < h1 > Welcome to My Website < /h1 >
                <br><br>
                2. <strong> CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</strong><br>
                   - Purpose: CSS is used to control the presentation, formatting, and layout of HTML elements. It allows designers to apply styles such as fonts, colors, spacing, and positioning.<br>

                <br><br>
                3. <strong>JavaScript:</strong><br>
                   - Purpose: JavaScript is a scripting language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites. It can be used for form validation, creating interactive maps, animations, and more.
                   <br>- Example: document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello, World!";
